  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>The following chapters describe how to deal with classic/old style of JSF development. We
    recommend users to use JBoss
    Seam to simplify development, but until then you can read about classical JSF 
    usage here.</para>
  
  <para>Thus, in this document we are going to show you how to create a simple <property>JSF application
  </property>using <property>JBoss Tools</property> plugins for Eclipse. The completed
    application will ask a user to enter a name and click a button. The resulting new page
    will display the familiar message, &quot;Hello &lt;name&gt;!&quot; This
    tutorial will show you how to create and run such an application from the beginning along the
    way demonstrating some of the powerful features of <property>JBoss Tools</property>.</para>
  <section><title>Key Features of JSF Tools</title>
    <para>Here, we provide you with a key functionality which is integrated in JSF tooling.</para>
