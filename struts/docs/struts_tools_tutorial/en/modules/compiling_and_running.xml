        <para>As this is the Eclipse environment, no explicit compilation step is required. By
        default, Eclipse compiles as you go.</para>

        <para>Thus at this point everything is ready for running our application without having to leave JBoss
            Developer Studio by using the JBoss Application Server engine that comes with the JBoss
            Developer Studio. For controlling JBoss AS within JBoss Developer Studio, there is JBoss
            Server view.</para>

                <para>Start up JBoss AS by clicking on the icon in JBoss Server view. (If JBoss AS
                    is already running, stop it by clicking on the red icon and then start it again.
                    Remember, the Struts run-time requires restarting the servlet engine when any
                    changes have been made.)</para>

                <para>After the messages in the Console tabbed view stop scrolling, JBoss AS is
                    available. At this point, right-click on the getName global forward in the
                    struts-config.xml diagram view and select Run on Server.</para>
